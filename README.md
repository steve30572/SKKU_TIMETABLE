# SKKU course enrollment backpack
This is HTML implementation for the ease of use for SKKU course enrollment

## Introduction
//proposal 처럼 동기같은것도 넣고 그러면 어떨까요?   
SKKU course enrollment backpack website supports to see the whole course list with some attributes. If the user wants to add the course to their backpack, they can click the button. If they add the course to their backpack, our website automatically adds the course to their backpack list and also checks if the courses we added has some overlapped time between them and also makes the time schedule to increase the visibility.
